		[Name 1]: The road ahead is as bleak as ever. Do you ever get used to this darkness?

		[Name 0]: Not really. Every shadow seems to hide something worse than the last. How long have you been traveling like this, [Name 1]?
		
		[Name 1]: Feels like forever, but it's only been a few months. And you, [Name 0]? What's your story?
		
		[Name 0]: I've been on the move for about a year now. Lost my home to raiders. Since then, I've just been trying to survive. Do you ever think we'll find something better?
		
		[Name 1]: I hope so. It's hard to keep faith, but meeting others like you, it helps. Makes the road a bit less lonely.
		
		[Name 0]: I agree. It’s strange how quickly we have to trust each other in times like these. But I’m glad we met. We stand a better chance together.
		
		[Name 1]: Yeah, we do. Let’s keep moving. Maybe together, we can find a bit of light in all this darkness.
